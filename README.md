# Using CSS Grid

CSS Grid allows us to rapidly build responsive layouts for websites. Similar to flexbox, you can use grid properties to build parts of an
HTML page that grow and shrink dynamically, looking good on a variety of screen sizes.

However, where flexbox gives you very granular control over how individual elements stretch, shrink and behave in a flex container, grid places a greater emphasis on setting up the rules of the container itself, automatically handling the stretching and shrinking of elements by aligning them to predetermined rows and columns.

#### `display: grid` and `display: inline-grid`
